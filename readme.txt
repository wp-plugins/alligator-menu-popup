Add the 'mpopup' class to a menu item in a custom menu to open the target in a popup Window.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you open the target of a menu item in your WordPress custom menu in a popup window. It was developed as a fork of my [Alligator Popup plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/alligator-popup/ "Alligator Popup plugin") which opens links within the page content in a popup window.

An admin page allows you can control the size of the popup window and whether it has scrollbars. Add the 'mpopup' class to a menu item in a custom menu to open the target in a popup Window.

#### Usage:

You will find the Alligator Menu Popup Settings Page at Settings => Menu Popup

* Set the dimensions of the popup window and whether you want the popup window to be scrollable

Then edit your custom menu at Appearance => Menus

* Enable the CSS Classes option in the Screen Options pull-down panel on the menu editor page.

* Add the mpopup class to any menu item where you want the target page to open in a popup window.

When the menu item is clicked, the link should now open in a popup window.
