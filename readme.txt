Add the 'mpopup' class to a menu item in a custom menu to open the target in a popup Window.

== Description ==

This is a fork of my similarly named Alligator Popup Plugin. Unlike the original plugin, this one enables you to open the target of a menu item of your WordPress custom menu in a popup window.

Add the 'mpopup' class to a menu item in a custom menu to open the target in a popup Window.

Enables you to specify that a menu item on your WordPress custom menu will open in a new popup window. An admin page allows you can control the size of the popup window and whether it has scrollbars.

#### Usage:

You will find the Menu Popup Settings Page at Settings => Menu Popup

* Set the dimensions of the popup window and whether you want the popup window to be scrollable

Then edit your custom menu at Appearance => Menus
* Enable the CSS Classes option in the Screen Options pull-down panel on the menu editor page.

* Add the mpopup class to any menu item where you want the target page to open in a popup window.

When the menu item is clicked, the link should now open in a popup window.


== Installation ==
Install the same as any other plugin

You can receive free support for the plugin if you have problems getting it working.
